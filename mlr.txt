1. what is normalization & standardization and how is it helpful?

Normalization:
Def: Normalization scales individual samples to have unit norm.
formula:
xi=xi-min(x)/max(x)-min(X)
used for distance calculations, such as knn or neural networks.


Standardization:
Def: Standardization transforms data to have a mean of zero and a std of one.

Formula: xi=xi-U/std

used for that assumes normally distributed data or are to feature scales, such as linear regression, or SVM

2. what techniques can be used to address multicollinearity in multiple linear regression?

ans:) Multicollinearity:

def: occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated, making it difficult to isolate the individual effect of each predictor.

effects: inflates the variance of coefficient estimates, leading to unreliable and unstable estimates.
Techniques to Address Multicollinearity:

1. remove Highly Correlated Predictors: Identify and remove correlated predictors using correlation matrices or Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
2. combine Features: Create new features by combining correlated ones, such as averaging them or taking their product.
3. principal Component Analysis (PCA): Transform features into a set of uncorrelated components.
4. regularization Techniques: Use Ridge or Lasso regression to penalize the size of coefficients, thus reducing the impact of multicollinearity.
