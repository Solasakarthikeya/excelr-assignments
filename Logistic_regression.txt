what is the difference between precision and recall?

def: precision, also known as positive predictive value, is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.

formula:

precision = true positive/true positive + false positive

precision answers the question, "Of all the instances that were predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?" High precision means that the model has a low false positive rate.



recall:

def: recall, also known as Sensitivity or true positive rate, is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all the observations in the actual class.

formula: recall = true positive/true positive + false negative

recall answers the question, "Of all the actual positive instances, how many were predicted correctly" high recall means that the model has a low false negative rate.


difference: 
-> Precision is critical when the cost of a false positive is high.

-> Recall is important when the cost of a false negative is high. 



2. what is cross-validation, and why is it important in binary classification?


cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate the performance of a model on a limited data sample. the most common form of cross-validation is k-fold cross-validation.

1. improves Model Generalization: Cross-validation helps ensure that the model’s performance is robust and not just tailored to a particular train-test split.
2. prevents Overfitting: By evaluating the model on different subsets of the data, cross-validation reduces the risk of overfitting to the training data.
3. more Reliable Performance Metrics: Provides a more accurate estimate of the model’s performance by averaging results over multiple folds.
4. model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning: Helps in selecting the best model and tuning hyperparameters by comparing the performance of different models/configurations on the validation sets.
